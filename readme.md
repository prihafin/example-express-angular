# Simple nodejs express + Angular example

First, run `npm i` in both `backend-example` and `frontend-example` folders to install needed dependecies.



Run the backend with `ts-node .` (might need to install `ts-node` with `npm i -g ts-node`)

Run the frontend with `ng serve`



Backend listens to http port 81 and has CORS disabled.

Frontend listens to http port 80, so just open browser to http://localhost
